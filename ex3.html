Then when he clicks a "Submit" button, it displays the year they were born. Hints at the bottom of this file.-->

## Hint

Look at angular-examples/3-hello-world-2.html for an example of how to do form submissions.

You get get the date via: `new Date()` - it will return a Date object. Once you have the date object, you get use its `getFullYear()` method to get the current year. -->
